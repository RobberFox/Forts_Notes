### General tips
1. Against players that constantly buzzsaw - put doors before weaponry[^1]
2. Use Emp's alongside a rocket rush. It's better than only rockets

[^1]: The rockets will be 1 min late, but the enemy is also behind in expansion since he spent resources on buzzsaws.
##### Idea
Late EMPs catch your opponent off guard.
### Shooting
>[!multi-column]
>>Think of the shooting point as the point in the middle *(below the ridge above the bottom)*.
>>**Basically:** where the little yellow tick-triangle is.

### Rush
**15 second window:** Rockets *(60s build time)* > Shotguns *(45s build time)*
### Defense: [[Tiny doors]]
**TareTar:** Best thing is to just get sandbags for firebeams. Cannons can just be tanked with more doors, and howitzer/nuke can be shot down with shotguns.
##### Splash resistance 
##### Laser resistance: [[Firebeam-Laser]]

### My issues
>[!warning] Greed once killed me
>Frequently at ~5 minutes I have single rocket doors and t2 single shots me.

>[!warning] Look where you are shooting
>In the heat of the moment I might auto-shoot without looking and like 50% of my shots are going nowhere for ~2 minutes
