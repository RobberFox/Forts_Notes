### Pinch heavy mortars
>[!definition] Pinch Build order ([[Forts-Rush|Dranistian style]])
>3rd mine -> 3 turbines -> 4th mine -> Workshop -> 5-6th mine -> Upgrade center *(delete 2 metal)* -> 6 mortars -> Portals -> Upgrade.

>[!definition] No eco triple/quad mortar 2:00
Workshop -> 2 Turbines -> Upgrade center -> 4 mortars *(by deleting storage)* -> Mine *(by selling off, Hallrassy style)* -> delete turbine/upgrade -> portal *(by selling off again)*

>[!example]-  Other build orders 
**Firebird Build order**
Mine -> Turbine -> Workshop -> 5 mines *(in total)* -> 2-nd turbine -> 7-8 mortars -> Portal/sniper/stability/wood
### Design
>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] Stability tech integration
>>1. Build the lower triangle as tall as possible to make ==comfy== turbine tower.
>>2. Make the vertical 4 long as long as possible. Create the center triangle *(see photo)* - you need to avoid some mortar tower struts for that.

[^1]: Core height minigunners have bad angles at the bottom
