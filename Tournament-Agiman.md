Me and Hallrassy
### Maps
[[Vanilla]]
[[Hang Time]]
### Game review
##### 1/16
[[Phoenix-1-16]]
[[Nameless King-1-16]]
[[Spat Prishli-1-16]]
##### 1/8
[[Oig-1-8]]
[[Nameless King-1-8]]
##### Finale
[[Nameless King-1-2]]
### Notions
**1/8:** [[Hang Time]] - Phoenix might go with buzzsaws $\implies$ build our own buzzsaw as counter.
>[!warning] We need proper immunity to buzzsaws

**1/4:** [[Spire]]
### In the end
We came 3rd. 
**1/4:** Lost to Nameless King *(Wind, zvezdochka)* on [[Spire]]. They went immediate 3 incendiary mortars -> AP sniper -> Rockets + upgraded mortars
>[!warning] We couldn't shoot due to angles

They had better map control
##### But we redeemed the 3rd place
[[Desert Ruins-Mortar-Portal]] into firebeams.
We struggled with t3 miniguns then Hallrassy cleared them
Slowly chipped away the foundation + firebeams and gg.
