>[!definition] Eco cannon spook
>3rd mine -> Turbine -> 4th mine -> Turbine -> 5th-6th mines -> Storages -> Upgrade center -> Munitions plant -> 4 turbines *(6 in total)* -> Upgrade all mines -> Battery/spend some metal if you float, 2-3 cannons.

**Goal:** full super mines, first cannon at 5:30
Minimize the slouche by not angling the bottom part *(drag the bottom diagonal 4 longs prematurely)*
### Design
[[Stability]]
1. Add the bottom diagonal 4 longs asap *(usually 2 turbines in)*
2. Prestress other planks and then add the last 4 long so that it doesn't become the limiting factor when making large cannon stacks..
3.

>>This also makes the centerplank shorter => easier to make [[Stability#Advanced stability]]
