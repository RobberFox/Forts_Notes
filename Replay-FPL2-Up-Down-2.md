### Late game: 9+ min
##### Stability

>>[!definition] Vykro's stability
>>[[Stability|Best of both worlds:]] below are 3x3 boxed and above are 4x2s

Even while broken down in late game the tower is still standing.
##### Offensive play
>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] Insane sequence by Helicopter:
>>1. Weaken wood wish nuke splash.
>>2. Pierce with buzzsaws.
>>*- like with [[Replay-FPL2-FMMC5-Mech70-1#^1f2490|Etan and Firework]]*

>>[!definition] In total: mcc72k /Helicopter cooperation
>>1. **Double nuke:** weaken wood.
>>2. **Buzzsaw:** pierce.
>>3. **Plasma:** pierce.

**Helicopter and mcc72k are efficient with metal:** almost no excess *(only 200 by mcc72k)*
##### The end
>[!multi-column]
>>**Helicopter:** Late game mortar transfer. Introduces big ==variety of threats==[^1].

[^1]: This is why I love double t1.

### Conclusion
1. There is always sniper map control
2. Heavy buzzsaw usage in this game. **Almost insane level of buzzsaws**
3. Weaken wood and pierce is the best combo.
