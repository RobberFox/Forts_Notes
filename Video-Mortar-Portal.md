### Introduction
>[!definition] Portalled mortars
>A fragile machine that you will see coming immediately, but that's not the point: the idea is to deliver a punch by surpassing the AA with brute force.
>They have been overlooked because of the design complexity. My goal is to fix that.

### Basic theory
##### Improving the setup
Most beginners build portalled mortars like this: `insert plancha portalled mortars`
1. First we are going to narrow the foundation plank, this makes the mortar tower cheaper and lighter. But we can do better:
2. Like this, mortar's hitbox gets in the way of shooting `show the debug mode with hitboxes and shooting arc`. Let's angle the foundation planks maximally *(showcased by the level icon)* 2 things happens: a) mortar's hitbox corner doesn't block the shooting anymore b) the barrel extends more past its' mortar's hitbox. `show the hitbox side-by-side` This happens since mortar's aiming arc is always pointing up, even if the mortar is upside down.
##### Defining the proper setup
- The foundation plank should be 20-30 energy wide, and the height should be 31-34 energy tall. Precise measurements depend on the map and your setup.
- For large stacks the entry portal should be long and a bit angled so it's perpendicular to the maximal shooting angle - this way you get the most portal coverage and thus - better shells concentration `show 6 flying shells`.

>[!tip] The hard part is getting the right tower lean for easy mortar placement
>1. Making the tower perpendicular to the foundation plank makes for a tiny tolerance, thus tilt it slightly and you can place the mortars right on the edge for comfortable shooting angles.
>2. To not build your tower like a curvy snake - use ropes as guidance.

*- Since nothing is perfect usually you still have to eye ball the mortar placement, this comes with practice*
### Examples on 3 maps
>[!definition] Philosophy and the proper approach
>1. **The amount of mortars:** 6 is a good choice since it groups nicely. `show control groups`, know that the physical limit is 10 group fired mortars. %% or at least it's my max achieved amount %%
>2. **Mortar tower orientation:** it should follow the shape of the base ~~ex: stalactites inverted setup~~
>3. **Utilizing the nodes:** when creating your own setup - you should integrate the mortar tower into the existing fort's structure `show abyss setup`

**Additionally:** the mortars should be in a protected place, like behind the core. But it's not always the case if portalled mortars is not your main rush. ~~e.g. you can plop down a stack of 3 heavy mortars in 60 seconds, \*wherever you want\*~~

>##### Roof hanging bases - Stalactites
### Shooting
##### Rope as an "angling device"
>[!example] Use ropes to angle the exit portal in accordance with your needs:
>if the enemy does a sniper spam - angle the portal up and make a "cradle of woodspam" to prevent doorsniping.

##### Targeting
You shouldn't blindly hit the woodspam, main interest points are weapons and the turbine tower. Try shooting max power with a single shell, reangle the portal if you miss your target. You can make your woodspam fan out `like such` for better flexibility in where you want to shoot *(at the expense of vulnerability)*.
### Real applications and an exhibition match (1 or 2 in total)
Here is a game against Der Benzin - a skilled forts player.

### Background %% IDK where to put this %%
So, I wanted to upload this video 2 months ago *(february 2024)*, but a lot of stuff happened since then.
1. I've switched to Linux. %% show 90s 3D modeling torus video with "Linux gaming experience" %%
2. I've soldered myself a split ergonomic keyboard. %% Show the soldering, photos, my Abyss Shotgun% speedrun %%
3. I've joined the FPL. %% show the game against Tatsumaki or Up Grade Sante %%
But I don't regret taking my time since I've refined some important concepts.
