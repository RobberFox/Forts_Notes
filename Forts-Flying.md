### Rant
In Vanilla buster is the way Vykro described but I think it would be cool to tell the perspective of Russian flying forts players (even if it's not Vanilla rant - i think it's going pretty fun listening to)

**Basics of flying forts:** 2 important things *(among some others)* are flying fort building and your piloting skill.
1. In building a flying forts there are 3 facets: Mobility *(how much load can your fort take before reaping)*, damage output, defence. Improving 1 facet greatly inhibits other so currently the most important thing is mobility. This is how the most successful ships look currently: `photo`
Biggest hurdle is balance since if you make your doors too big and heavy then you equally clumsy counterweight on the back making you fort an immobile blob.
2. Most valuable skill in piloting is learning is what we call "sway" *(раскачка)*: moving sideways manipulating the placement/deletion of the antigrav. You need access to struts to place your antigravs at.

**And here is the problem:** Buster rocket combo renders the ability of swaying useless since everything is burning. And knowing
The main strat is building a small-agile carrier and get very close *(preferably alternating shooting from top and bottom)* for rockets to land this is so incredibly annoying that banning buster rockets is an unspoken rule.


P.S. in general the whole moonshine fraction is superb in flying forts almost as if was made for flying.
