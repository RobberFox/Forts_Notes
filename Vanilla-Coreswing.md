### MetPre (Metal Preservation) swing
>[!multi-column]
>>1. **Most of the fort is left:** put the turbines atop. 
>>2. Keep the triangular wood piece for **node reserve**
>>3. Drag the diagonal and don't care about the cleanness. ASAP attachment is the only thing that matters here.
>>4. Keep the rope for tensile integrity[^1]

[^1]: **It's possible to die if you swing very low and then delete the ropes:** thus make the triangle higher up so the core won't go too low

>[!multi-column]
>>[!tip] Implementing coreswing with stability
>>1. The core is dropped further back.
>>2. Easier to attach.
>>3. Don't need to delete the coreswing "leftovers"
>>**To not die:** make stability high so the rope attaches higher.

##### Swinging minimally
1. Diagonal 4 long for support
3. Small triangle for the swing *(make it almost diagonally up)*
### Other swings

>>##### Swift swing 
>>![[Pasted image 20231118144239.png]]
>>1. The rope has to be close to the minimal radius *(visual queue: node has to be on the cog at 4:30 o'clock)*
>>2. Triple wood plank connection to the additional node.
>>**Problem:** atrocious foundation connection with unnecessary height.
