>[!definition] Build order
>Armoury -> Turbine -> Mine ->  Minimal stability/Upgrade center[^1]-> Coreswing -> 3 armoury weapons -> 2nd turbine -> Upgrade -> 3-4th turbines.
*- Place a sniper somewhere around here*
   
[^1]: You can time deleting core wood with placing upgrade center to coreswing faster.
##### Expansion notion
[[TareTar3]] ;;x
First shooting cycle -> get more turbines.
If I excess energy -> upgrade mines. If I excess metal -> upgrade turbines.
**In parallel:** place 2 batteries 1 *(then another one)* storage.
Once I excess both: tech up *(get more rockets in parallel)*. 
### Coreswing
>[!multi-column]
>>[!blank-container]
>>>[!definition] The idea is such (this is raw)
>>>Keep the front metal and place weapons behind it to prevent buzzsaws. 
>>
>>1. The weapons placement and tiny doors *(all that behind the front metal layer)* is hard.
>>2. I spend a lot of resources to prevent deformation after coreswing $\implies$ my coreswing time doesn't keep up with armoury. Check [[TareTar3]]

##### What I need to figure out
2. Prevent buzzsaws from shooting top/bottom foundations.
3. Doing something with back turbines *(since I can't build the weapons up, they start blocking the turbines)*
4. Mortar defence at the top
