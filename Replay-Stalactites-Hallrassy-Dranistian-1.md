### Early game offense: 3-6 min
>[!multi-column]
>>Dranistian notices Armory from Hallrassy and doesn't defend his doors from buzzsaws.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240125150541.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>**Hallrassy mind game:** double door that is unnoticeable.
>>![[Pasted image 20240125150919.png]]
>
>>**4:30 map control:** Hallrassy's AP sniper killed Dranistians shotguns.[^1]
>>![[Pasted image 20240125150947.png]]

>[!tip] Looking out for AP sniper
Dranistian could listen to the upgrade sound and see that there were 3 upgrades with 2 upgraded mines.

[^1]: a) AP sniper oneshots Shotguns b) Shotguns are better target since rockets are nothing without them and Dranistian can't kill Hallrassy's AA.

>[!warning] But Dranisitan bounced back due to Overdrive
>Got shotguns back in one minute *(4:30-5:30)*
### Mid game: 6-9 min 
Hallrassy halfway build the plasma.
>[!definition] 6:20: Dranistian attacks with workshop's [[buzzsaw]]
>![[Pasted image 20240125151727.png]]
>
>**But:** Hallrassy could've sniped it. 

>[!multi-column]
>>Hallrassy didn't notice that there is no door building sound *(He could've sniped the EMP's)*
>
>![[Pasted image 20240125151757.png]]

- Dranistian slowly chips away the defence of Hallrassy.
##### Firebeam and [[Emp-Rocket]]
Hallrassy Shoots for the shotguns. 
>[!warning] Dranistian could put sandbags ([[Emp-Rocket#Defense|as TareTar suggested]])

![[Pasted image 20240125152929.png]]
### Late game: 9+ min
>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] 2 things happened
>>1. Burning shrapnel **from one shotgun** kills Hallrassy's [[Firebeam-Laser]]
>>2. Sniper "supports" the burning plank[^2]
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240125153234.png]]

[^2]: Burning of planks is "resetted" when you hit them.

**Back and forth:** both players are struggling *(stalemate)*

>[!definition] What could've been done
>**From Hallrassy's side:** EMP's to slow down Dranistian *(since he doesn't have proper AA)*
>**From Dranistian's side:** t2
##### 15th minute - 3 moments

##### The end
>[!multi-column]
>>[!blank-container] 
>>>[!warning] Dranistian (despite Overdrive) didn't upgrade mines untill 18:00
>>>On the other side: Hallrassy upgraded his mines throughout the game
>>
>>**The kill:** hallrassy got better attrition *(2 plasmas, rockets)*
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240125155517.png]]
### Conclusion
1. Sniper control *(captain obvious)*, listen to doors.
2. Being adaptive allows for greed and early weapons. 
3. Dranisitan didn't go for eco earlier $\implies$ no t2. Also no [[Emp-Rocket|laser defence]]
4. Hallrassy needed earlier t1 offence.

*- Also cool building tricks in the early game*
