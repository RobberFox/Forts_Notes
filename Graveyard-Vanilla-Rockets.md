##### Idea #2
>[!multi-column]
>>[!blank-container] 
>>>[!warning] Issues
>>>**Expensive:** 100 metal *(so... useful only with pinch due to 100% wood scrapping)*
>>>I don't keep up with my build order.
>>
>>Not buzzsawable if there is metal before 1:35
>>>[!tip] Try to keep the front wood 
>>>Thus making the tower itself cheaper

### Base design #1
>[!multi-column]
>>[!warning] Issues
>>This **"clean"** turbine tower setup is impossible if I want to have pre-swing turbines.
