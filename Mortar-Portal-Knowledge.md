### Breakthrough - tilting the mortars
>[!definition] Tilting the mortars
>1. The mortar hitbox corner stops getting in the way of shooting
>2. Mortar barrel can extend back even more $\implies$ more shooting angles

>[!warning] Adaptability
>1. If the stack is $\leq 6$, then make a lot of leeway for better shooting angles.
>2. Else, ==don't be scared of stacking mortars real vertically, there is enough tolerance==

### Shooting
You can leave 1 incendiary mortar as bait
>[!tip] Shoot with faster cadence. For that:
>1. More turbines

>2. Clean setup without red crosses so you can auto-shoot 
>[!algorithm] Agglomerated shots strat - for maximally condensed projectiles
>1. Start auto fire from the first volley.
>2. Once the doors fully open - shoot from other other volleys. 

When trying to finish off with a sniper - quickly group fire mortars in between sniper's reload.
