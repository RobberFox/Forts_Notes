[[Replay-Pillars-1]] ;;x
### Setup %%Name: Commander, strategy%%
**Me:** [[Firebird]], [[Mortar|mortars]]
**Beetle:** [[Phantom]], turtle defence into late [[Swarm-Nuke|nuke]]
### Beginning: rush 0-3 min
**2nd minute:** I could've killed Beetle Schuka style If aimed my mortars at the top of the core *(~42% power full flat angle)*

### Early game offence: 3-6 min
>[!multi-column]
>>**Idea #1:** If I had upgrade center I could've killed the trenches with an AP sniper
>>**Idea #2:** I could've went for armoury *(cheaper than upgrade center)* and shoot with firebird active flaks.

### Mid game: 6-9 min
>[!look]
>**Learn good back turbines design:** it stopped me from properly expanding and I couldn't go for laser tech *(similar to [[Replay-Pillars-1#Early game offence 3-6 min]])*

>>[!tip] Try implemeting t2 more into firebird build and see what happens
>>**That turbine is always vulnerable:**
>>1. I could've toppled Beetle's base with a shotgun + buzzsaw.
>>2.  I've won against [CMV] Matveyev with 1 buzz *(25th February 2024)* 
>>3. Low mortars *([[Pillars-Mortar-Firebird|Der Benzin]])*

### Late game: 9-17 min
>[!multi-column]
>>1. **Since I was committed to t1:** I should've kept on the firebird active pressure with minigunners and flaks[^1], but I didn't
>>2. **And again:** AP sniper.
>>3. But in general there was a hiatus in my base expanding due to shit back turbines and not being able to place stuff properly *(lasers would've won the game instead of me excessing that metal)*

[^1]: in the picture it's visible how good of a job it does

##### The end
>[!multi-column]
>>I didn't have splash defence *(really work on build design on [[Pillars]])*
