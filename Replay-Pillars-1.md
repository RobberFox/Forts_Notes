### Setup
**Me:** Mortars. [[Pinchfist]]
**Beetle:** Full turtle + very late cannons. [[Spook]]

>[!warning] My problem
>1. Since I swore not to use t2 for 1 month - my options are limited. I could kill off Beetle with t2 easily *(his core was exposed)*
>2. Better build order could save me APM and mental overhead *(I was hesitating a lot)*

### Beginning: rush 0-3 min
Rush was off, I was freestyling: [[Pillars-Mortar-Firebird]] *(6 incendiary mortars at 2:30 is lazy)*
**250 metal excess (before 3 minutes):** unoptimized coreswing.
![[Pasted image 20231223174607.png]]
##### **What I need:** 
1. Early buzzsaw to cut trench gunners and follow up with sniper.
2. More eco *(quad mines at least)*, less energy *(1-2 turbines is enough for incendiary mortars)*
3. My turbine tower is vulnerable[^1] . I could place one close turbine or use sandbags.

[^1]: Beetle could buzzsaw my turbine and follow up with a sniper to kill all of my mortars.

### Early game offence 3-6 min
1. I could smartly overwhelm Beetle with [[Mortar|mortars]] *(also: [[Pillars-Mortar-Firebird|pillars mortars shooting strength]])*
2. **4th minute:** I could kill Beetle off with AP sniper into the core. [^2] Additionally I could start killing gunners on the roof.

[^2]: Beetle went for defending his trench gunners instead of defending the core. **Conclusion:** I could do one thing or the another in either case *(since beetle puts his eco only in one basket or the other)*

**5th minute:** that lower mine reconstruction was ugly *(I need proper build order)*
##### **What I need:**
>[!multi-column]
>>1. My armory is blocking the turbines *(I NEED PROPER BUILD ORDER)*. That was haunting me all the way till the end.
>

2. I need constant access to a buzzsaw
### Mid game 6-10 min (AP kill could be done till 7 min)
I need smarter [[Smokebomb]] shooting *(it was depleting too fast)*
**Be aware of where you shoot:** my rockets were shooting into nothingness 
**Random metal and ENERGY excess:** I could place storages.
##### **What I need:**
1. More eco to capitalize on the rush *(4 unupgraded mines is too low)*
>[!multi-column]
>>2. **Probably (but not 100%):** I could cheese without having "door wall" that costs around 1000 metal *(and instead go for eco)* since Beetle is overwhelmed and doesn't have buzzsaws.[^3]
>==It's player dependant:== against [CMV] Matveyev I will always place door wall.

>>3. **BUZZAW AGAIN:** also flaks/shotguns to kill trench gunners.

>[!multi-column]
>>4. Shotguns is better option in this case *(I need to get used to my [[Forts-Hotkey|hotkeys]])*. I could've also tried destroying the mines.

### Late game 10-16: The turning point
*- Most issues listed above are prevalent*
**14th minute:** the turning point: quad rockets kill the Beetle's cannon.
>[!tip] To finish him off faster I needed more energy
>And again rockets shooting nowhere 

[^3]: If beetle had a buzzsaw he would need to defend it from AP sniper $\implies$ less recourses for trench gunners *(see how this snowballs?)*

### Upside:
>[!multi-column]
>>I had hecka lot of weapon defense, **but:** core defense should've been the priority
