### Setup %%Name: Commander, strategy%%
>[!multi-column]
>>**EtaN:** 6 mines, behind geiger in nukes.
>> **Firework=balanced:** EMP harassment + building firebeam, eco *(5-6 mines)*, t2 tech. Core exposed below.
>
>>**Geiger=weapon rush:** low eco *(3 mines)*, fast nuke.
>>**Malme=Eco:** 7 mines, almost no weapons. Core exposed below.
### Lazy beginning & early game: 0-6 min

>[!look]
>Everyone has a sniper for early game map control.

>[!multi-column]
>>[!blank-container] 
>>1. **Defend roof:** Malmeo shoots $\swarrow$ Firework's firebeam[^1]
>>2. Below doors vulnerable to buzzsaws.

>>Shot under = 400 metal[^2] 

[^1]: Good for Malme - playing with the verticality of the map.
[^2]: **Opportunity for Malme:** didn't take it even though had 2 buzzsaws

>[!multi-column]
>>**1-2:** Cool double defence from EtaN.
>>**3:** replacing mine with a swarm *(very uncommon)*
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240104122053.png]]

>[!warning] Malme doesn't have weaponary
### Mid game: 6-9 min 
>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] Etan and Firework cooperating (splash to pierce combo)
>>**Etan first with nukes** - weakens the wood with splash.
>>**Firework with double firebeam**[^3] - pierces the damaged wood.
>

[^3]: **Interesting choice:** works more as a support and AA counter.

>[!multi-column]
>>>[!graveyard] 
>>Lucky drunk nuke by Malme kills EtaN.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240104123102.png]]

>[!look]
>Both Malme and Firework reclaim their allies asap.

### Late game: 9+ min
>[!multi-column]
>>[!warning] Firework doesn't defend against buzzsaws
>>Malme could collapse the **#2** pillar.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240104123341.png]]

>[!graveyard] Firework has 5k metal excess. It grows beyond 10k[^4]
>EtaN is more efficient with metal by having 0 excess right till the end.

[^4]: Malme is also efficient with having only 300 metal excess. **But again:** he didn't have weaponary to harass Firework.
##### The end
>[!multi-column]
>>Firework uses the verticality of the map and shoots Malme from below.

### Conclusion
1. On FMMC5 nukes are exceptionally good due to close distance.
2. Hanging maps don't use stability *(like on [[Desert Ruins]] Hallrassy told be)*
