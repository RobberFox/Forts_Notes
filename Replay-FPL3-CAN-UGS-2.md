### Setup %%Name: Commander, strategy%%
*- Out opponents have adapted, we need more strategies*
>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] Firebird
>>**Me:** fkin slow 4:00 portalled mortars + late game armoury
>>**Pechivo:** Armoury support + mid game swarm -> nuke
>
>>[!definition] Armourdillo (the bane of our game)
>>**PileRoullee:** Armoury turtle defence + late game laser tech
>>**Cypres:** Woodspam turtle + mid game firebeam/plasma combo
### Beginning: rush 0-3 min
>[!multi-column]
>>**2:45:** Too slow of a Firebird offense.
>

### Early game offense: 3-6 min
>[!multi-column]
>>Wasting my APM on fixing my sniper spots. **Task:** I need proper setup: [[Stalactites]]
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407141151.png]]

*- Because of this I've excessed 400 metal and was behind in attrition this whole game*

>[!multi-column]
>>Pechivo's bottom flak doesn't have angles. For that one it's fine to have 2 long door.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407141508.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>[!example] This happens too often
>>After  poorly placed portal I'm wasting time on tilting it. This time my expansion has collapsed.
>

### Mid game: 6-9 min 
>[!multi-column]
>>Stupid by Cypres
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407141745.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>[!warning] 8-th fkin minute
>>I still don't have shit[^1]
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407141850.png]]

[^1]: Weird thing is that I haven't excessed past that "sniper setup" incident.
### Late game: 9+ min
>[!multi-column]
>>**9-th minute:** Great but not enough *(bittersweet)*
>>>[!look]
>>>~~For example:~~ I could have had upwards angled lasers way earlier. **[[WIP-Replay-FPL3-CAN-UGS-3#Late game 9+ min|I REALLY NEED TO ANGLE UPWARDS MY WEAPONARY ON HANGING BASES]]**
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407142021.png]]


>[!multi-column]
>>**11-th minute:** same thing but with buzzsaw
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407142613.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>[!example] Could've been a game saviour
>>If I controlled the map with my snipers and took down the AA - I could dig through the top base *(and not care about the cripplied bottom base)*
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407142702.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>**12-th minute:** didn't see that coming from PileRouillee 
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407142837.png]]
##### The enders
>[!multi-column]
>>[!warning] We should've kept on banning armourdillo
>>This time we hadn't done that and Pechivo died from the penetration.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407142930.png]]

*- Even more pitty: I was missing shots after Pechivo dying, I even could've penetrated into PileRouille's base*

>[!multi-column]
>>Then I just was hammered with mortars and lasers and did a cheeky coreswing into the abyss
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407143801.png]]
### Conclusion
- PileRoulle doing 50k/vs my 40k damage shows that I was behind in attrition. Also Pechivo's nukes weren't landing, he did 4k damage.
1. **Potentially:** they've won since they could tank the shots with armourdillo[^2]
2. Firebird is unprecedented in being the most APM intensive commander. It requires crazy focus too overwhelm your opponent with crap weapons *(like Schuka does)*. Could've tried buster instead
3. I now have a comfy 6 mortar setup on [[Stalactites-Mortar-Portal|stalactites]] which should be a nice DPS bonus.

[^2]: But I got scared and banned architect, since [[Replay-Architect]] and tier-list by Etan ranking Architect as S.
