[[Mortar-Portal]]
### Firebird 6 mortars.
>[!definition] Build order
>Workshop -> Top Mine -> Turbine -> 6 mortars/portal.

Start lower volley -> wait till the inner door builds -> start the second volley and that should be a kill.
### Design
##### Wood setup
>[!multi-column]
>>1. Angle the 30 long base wood minimally.
>>2. "Shoot for the node" and drag the 4 long *(mental calc: 95/3~32)*
>>3. Angle the entry portal a bit *(to be $\perp$ to the shooting angle)*
>>4. Nudge the 2-nd mortar a bit and "pick that new angle" *(imagine a line that goes across the back of the mortars)*

>[!tip] To stack more than 8 mortars 
>You can make the group leader the top mortar so it will trigger the door.
##### Door
1. You can have portal at the front of the core *(as in the photo)* 
2. Use the existing door
