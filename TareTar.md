>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] Setup for a good base
>>1. **Build from the top down:** you can use the grid when you setup for Vykro's stability tech.
>>2. **Create counterweight:** you can build back till you get blinkies.

### Stability tech & woodspam
>[!multi-column]
>>[!example] When you mess up the stability and can't get the tilted 4 long
>>1. Drag 4 longs from behind.
>>2. Setup the Narf node and drag to it

>[!warning] WIP - additional stability before the core strut starts blinking

>[!multi-column]
>>[!example]  Sequential flow: 
>>When 2 longs start blinking 
>>-> Get 3 *(or 4)* longs, when 3 longs start blinking 
>>-> Get 4 longs.

*- For "hex" stability pattern: woodstack from the place where there aren't existing planks*
##### Woodspam stability 
>[!multi-column]
>>[!example] When you build thick woodspam
>>Drag from the core strut and get 4 longs.

### Turbines
>[!multi-column]
>>[!warning] Turbine precaution
>>Stability inside turbines

>>![[Pasted image 20240211210057.png]]
##### Back turbines
>[!multi-column]
>>>[!tip] 
>>>Don't build cannons too back to leave space for back turbines.
>>
>>1. For turbine tower have 4 longs.
>>*- Build the shown diagonal pattern*
>>2. Go ==a bit sideways== with 4 longs so turbine tower will go to the side a bit. [[Forts-Megabase|Though that's bad for megabases]]
>>3. **Back turbine tower:** 3x3 boxes *(or with [[Box fitting|box fitting it's 65]])*

### Weapons
>[!multi-column]
>>[!blank-container] 
>>>[!warning] Aggressive cannon tilt
>>>To get more shooting angles to the core.
>>>*- Increase the tilt when you build higher up*
>>
>>>[!tip] Staircasing
>>>It makes the base more stable
>>
>>**Better weapon protection:** place sandbags at the lower part of tiny door[^1]
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240211205419.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>[!example] Duplicating the cannon box 
>>**Also:** don't build boxes vertically, slouch them back a bit.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240211210248.png]]

[^1]: **Der Benzin:** 2 sandbags are good keep replacing them while your opponent shoots at you, with this technique you will win games.
### Trenches
[[Forts-AA-Trench]]
### Changing your mind and leaning even more
>[!multi-column]
>>[!example] Say someone is rushing you
>>You can build woodspam and then go back to making a counterweight by deleting the 3 long in the back.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240211210004.png]]
### Weaponry
>[!multi-column]
>>Stability for 12 cannon stack's lower 3 cannons
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240409131154.png]]
### Exhibition match
[[Vanilla-Cannon]] ;;x

>[!multi-column]
>>**Different stability:**
>>The initial rear Vykro's stability is kept. Then you go by 4 longs.
>>Make the second turbine plank a bit narrow so your rear stability wont go diagonally back *(make 4 longs vertical instead)*
