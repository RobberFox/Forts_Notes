>Foreground bracing holds more weight, you can abuse that

**3x3 boxes:** better for shearing and front-back force bearing.
**4x2 boxes:**  bear more weight but snap horizontally if there is too much stress.

### Vanilla
**Vanilla front (Vykro's) stability:** 
a) drag the diagonal rhombus immediately, without creating additional planks.
b) If there is a lot of slouche: do the bottom part and then add the vertical 4 longs *(rhombus)* after some weight.
##### Advanced stability
>[!multi-column]
>>Increased stability before the diagonal 2 long starts blinking.
>>**If the shorter 4 long doesn't drag:** woodstack from an auxiliary plank.

>[!multi-column]
>>Do the bottom 4 long with an additional 3 long a bit to the side.
>>Make the munitions plant angled towards the core to free space for a battery below.

>>##### Bottom back
>>>[!definition] To ease the Y shape building.
>>>1. The front 4 long is shorter.
>>>2. The triangle is wide.

### Tar
You can drag the 4 longs for "triangular, diagonal, intersecting 4 longs"
