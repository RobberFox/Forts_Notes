[^1]: Go from back triangle to front *(to not place useless support planks)* don't forget the last supportive 3 long *(in red)*
[^2]: Do the basic "minigun triangle" tiny door.

>>1. 3.5 long turbine tower *(for turbine efficiency)*
>>2. **Front metal defence:** setup for future tiny door [^2]. Don't add unecessary planks *(nothing should attach to the core from the front)*
