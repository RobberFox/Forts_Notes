### Setup %%Name: Commander, strategy%%
**Helicopter/mcc72k:** [[Warthog]], t2
**Vykro/Dranisitan:** [[Spook]], rockets *(to drain the energy production ig)*

### Early game offense: 3-6 min
Incursus stream turned off >:(
### Mid game: 6-9 min 
9 minutes:

>>Insane amount of rockets by Dranistian

>>Great eco by Vykro

>[!multi-column]
>>Rockets make so much harassment that lasers come out at 10:00

### Late game: 9+ min
>[!multi-column]
>>Despite Vykro and Dranisitan stopping lasers with smokes - Dranistian looses most of the weapons due to plasma and firebeam by Helicopter.
>>He almost gets cut with Plasma/Firebeam.

>[!warning] Just shows that you need to figure out thick defence for rockets
>I loose the same way against Hallrassy when going rockets. Once lasers are out - I'm crumbling down.
##### Despite that
**Good for Vykro and Dranistian:** mcc72k has NOTHING *(but he's tanking, like козёл отпущения)*[^1]
>[!multi-column]
>>**Vykro:** finally went lasers and increased harrasment.
>>**Dranistian:** did double t1 *(HOORAY!)* and started cutting with buzzsaws

[^1]: Team left is being indecisive as who to shoot, they could kill off Helicopter first, since he has the weapons.
##### Overwhelmed
>[!multi-column]
>>**Dranistian has open rockets:** technically Helicopter can shoot but in the heat of the moment he doesn't notice that[^2]

[^2]: This is why I have keybinds for camera placement, just quickly look at what's going on.

##### The end
**Vykro hits with plasma:** Helicopter gives up and cuts himself off.
>[!multi-column]
>>Buzzsaw kills mcc72k's wooden base.

### Conclusion
1. I need to use smokes more and smarter.
2. Shotguns are doorsnipers not only for AA.
