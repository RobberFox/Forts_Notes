### Beginning
Hello there, here is a vanilla rocket rush. One variation is with the Seep commander, other with Pinchfist. Enjoy.
### Prerequisites
There are two prerequisites:
##### 1. Tinier doors
>[!multi-column]
>>
>>First: **Tinier doors:** the EMP's shoot their projectiles way above the rockets sprite.
>> **Basically:** where the little yellow triangle is *(as shown in the photo)*. 
>>You obstruct the doors with wood to prevent doorsnipes. You only need to shoot for the foundations anyway.

##### 2. Coreswing
>[!multi-column]
>>Secondly: **Coreswing:** this one I would like to call "metal preservation" coreswing *(MetPre for short)*, because it allows you to swing without deleting front metal.
>>This is useful for placing turbines early on.
>>*- text: also don't worry if you don't attach the first time*

### First rush - Seep
Now comes the rush with the Seep commander.
1. **Here the metal is utmost importance:** deleting it and placing it back somewhere else is not gonna cut it. You can see the benefit of the MetPre coreswing. It allows me to place 1 turbine early on.
2. After placing Armory -> Mine -> Turbine tower and deleting the storage comes the boring part. You just wait for the upgrade center. Here I really suggest setting up hotkeys for camera positions *(text: I really suggest you to have them)*
3. **Now the swing:** *(text: optimally place this triangle bit higher)* if you are wondering why I didn't die, watch my video about the "node reserve" mechanic *(Show the video)*.
**Also:** If you drag the diagonal plank *(Show photo)* it doesn't matter if you fail attaching, the rope will not snap.
4. This part is also boring, you just wait for the weapons.
>[!definition] The idea behind this build
>Is ability to opt for lasers if the rockets stop working

The upgrade timing is 30 seconds late in exchange for complete immunity to buzzsaws.

5. This rush uses 2 rockets, 1 shotgun and one sniper. **This is a downside:** since 2 rockets alpha-strike is pretty low. 
... and perfectly you can shoot the rockets at 2:30 but in the real game I got distracted by the enemy sniper. *(text: I got a 2:50 here)*

>[!look]
>After the rush it's just a matter of: game sense, building more turbines and starving you opponent.

Here I finished him off in 6 minutes.
### Second rush - Pinchfist
Now comes the rush with the Pinchfist commander. It's different since the turbine tower is taller to fit **quadruple rockets**. 
>[!look]
>Yes I opt shotguts for rockets because pinchfist allows for insane level aggression. 
1. **Here the energy is utmost importance:** thus I build 2 turbines early on.
2. After placing Armory -> Mine -> 2 turbines *(text: without deleting the storage)* comes the boring waiting ==again==. I hate this: my playstyle shows that I want to get into the action as fast as possible, this is why you won't see me rushing heavy weapons *(text: they are just plain boring)*
3. And here is the same swing once again.
>[!definition]  As I complete the swing let's examine the turbine tower:
>**Firstly:** These 3 wood planks provide stability, but they are vulnerable so this has to be fixed early on.
>**Secondly:** Fastest buzzsaw comes  at 1:35 thus replace the top wood with metal *(you won't regret it, I promise)*
4. **Here is another upside of using Pinchfist:** I fully rebuild the turbine tower without loosing metal. 
*- Also you can see that my opponent is turtling up with trench gunners*
And again boring waiting for the weapons.
>[!look]
>Some interlude is needed
4. My rockets are delayed again since "tinier doors" requre a lot of APM *(I'm still working on that)* nonetheless this is a sub 3 minute quad rocket rush.

>[!look]
>**Now the setup is over:** build more turbines. You will need around 300 energy production 

Lack of proper AA counter is a struggle, but after eventually starving my opponent I  finished him of with a shotgun *(that's the sound of a shotgun!)* 
### Ending
Thank you for 100 subscribers, for my humble standards it's an absolutely insane number. This video celebrates this cool milestone.
