>[!definition] Pinch 2:15 build order
>Workshop -> 2 turbines *(with "more stability")* -> 1 Mine -> Upgrade center -> 5 mortars -> 2 portals -> Upgrade 5 mortars -> 2 turbines

Then *(while shooting from mortars)*: 6 turbines in total then lasers or portalled nuke.

>[!definition] "Spook and else" build order (Basically like regular Pinch)
>Mine -> 2 turbines -> 4th mine -> Workshop -> 5th mine -> Upgrade center -> 5 mortars -> Upgrade mortars -> 3rd turbine / portals


### Design
>[!multi-column]
>>1. [[Stalactites#Turbines for better efficiency|EtaN's]] back turbine tower.
>>2. Double sniper for map control.
>>4. Buzzsaws in the woodspam, miniguns at the bottom[^1]

[^1]: Or make a dedicated 41 energy tall boxes
##### Weaponary
>[!definition] 5 Portalled mortars
>>[!multi-column]
>>>1. 20x32/33 boxes for mortars. Foundations horizontal-er [[Mortar-Portal|than usual]] *(since back turbines need efficiency)*
>>>2. Dodge the annoying node
>>>3. Initial mortar away from the core *(so the battery won't block it)*
>>>4. Further away portal allows for easier, concentrated shooting.

>The closer the portal to the ceiling - the steeper the arc


>[!definition] 6 Portalled mortars
>>[!multi-column]
>>>Sway the mortars a lot, since there isn't problem with the last mortar shooting almost into the door's node.
