[[Mortar-Portal-Knowledge]] ;;
### Notions
**Generally:** faster turbines, faster defence.

>[!definition] For 2v2
>1. [[Replay-FPL3-CAN-UGS-1#Early game offense 3-6 min]] - create second portal when you are about to excess metal
>2.  Try switching the targets if the current one is broken down and just turtling[^1]

[^1]: If the other player has weapons - it means that he doesn't have resources for defence.
##### Expansion
Place a battery asap to have energy for t2 at ~5 minutes, you can even place one prematurely
**When excessing energy:** I can upgrade the mines.
### Precaution
>[!warning] 
>When using mortars as a cannon supplement, put the mortars at the place that won't kill your base during a doorsnipe
