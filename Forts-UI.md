**First:** number the things that ==can't be changed== and wipe them off the list
### Issues
##### Camera movement
1. Startup zoom in to a base, it has 1 second delay and happens for 3 seconds *(4 seconds in total)*. Have option to disable it

>[!definition] Zooming inconsistency
>2. Zoom in is faster than zoom out, make it equal *(or allow to do so)*. ~~ex: mine is 3 ==slow== scrolls for full map zoom in, 6 ==slow== scrolls for zoom out~~
>3. When scrolling fast, most scrolls are ignored. ~~ex: 10 fast scrolls zoom in/out as much as 2 slow~~
##### Building
1. Need snapping devices side by side just like the mines/silos do *(avoid "pixel perfect placement" simulator)*
##### Shooting
##### Map selection
You have to use QWERTY keyboard so that pressing V picks Vanilla.
