>[!warning] Be patient with stability tech
>Have everything symmetric in front stability, go slow *(since weapons will block building)*
### Pinch
>[!definition] Dranistian style
>3rd mine -> 2 turbines -> 4th mine -> Armoury -> 5th mine -> Upgrade center -> 3rd turbine -> 4 armoury weapons -> Doors/upgrade/2 turbines *(5 in total)*
##### Mid game expansion
Lasers + rockets combo *(as in [[FPL-Season-2]])* or Workshop.
4x2 base design *(since I'm pretty low and don't need 3x3)*

##### Stability
>[!multi-column]
>>Just make the single wood silhouette to prevent doorsnipes *(or immediately transfer to tiny doors)*
>>1. Have the lower rocket high up.
>>2. Leave more door splace for top rocket.
>>3. Make tiny doors tucked and sandbag strut 20+ wide *(See: [[Abyss#Designs]])*
