>Checking for AP snipers with the default gunner - Cool idea.
>But nah. You can often tell by simply paying attention to what they're doing. For example, if you see a base of a competent player (external double armour layer sold, doesn't build useless ground nodes, places mines, etc.) but you can't hear anything being placed for a long time, while you'd expect tech or storage being placed at that point, then that's a red flag.

### Quirks
1. When you move device and you get doorsniped - the splash happens in 2 places.
2. 
### Examples
>[!example] FPL 2 exhibition match: Vykro & Dranistian *(Green Leaf)* vs Finn & Amburullo *(Danke Merkel)*
>Finn & Amburullo went into phantom heavy mortars supported with smokebombs

### Idea

**2v2 Stalactites Phantom shotgun:** using the active build down and undershot the core.
