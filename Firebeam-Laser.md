### Firebeam
>[!look]
>When you hit a a plank with device on it alongside the device - the burning plank damage and firebeam damage overlays.

Firebeams penetrate 90 units if the first strut they hit is metal and 160 if the first strut is wood.
Though if within the first 70 units after hitting wood it hits metal, it'll penetrate 90 units from the metal.
It doesn't matter how much material is in that 90 or 160 units, it'll just go trough. 
*- 50 units = 1 grid unit.*
