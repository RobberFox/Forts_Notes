### Knowledge
[[Pillars-Coreswing]]
Expand downwards immediately accounting for weapons: ~~rockets, miniguns~~
Might need more foundations on the lower expansion *(so that it won't collapse)*

>[!tip]
> Don't think about the main base much, 1 box of woodspam is sufficient for t1 slugfests, think more about weaponry, expansions
### Designs

>>**Don't stick out mines:** it's enough to have the sprite border *(roughly)* aligned with the wall.
>>**Ground node:** see [[Pillars-Rocket-Coreswing]]
