### Setup %%Name: Commander, strategy%%
>[!multi-column]
>>**Me:** messed up rocket rush
>>**Helicopter:** graded eco into howie + cannons
>
>>**MisterTwister:** graded eco into double howie
>>**Wind:** perfect timing plasma + 2 firebeams *([[EtaN]] style)*
### Beginning: rush 0-3 min
I've messed up 2 turbines placement so had to reposition them *(costed me 40 seconds)*
### Early game offense: 3-6 min
### Mid game: 6-9 min 
### Late game: 9+ min
##### The end
### Conclusion
1. Look at the opponents: they were both turtling, Wind had perfect timing laser tech[^1] so I could be faster instead of placing buzzsaw defence.
2. Should've targeted Wind because I noticed the [[EtaN|EtaN style lasers]]

[^1]: So he couldn't have placed a 1:35 buzzsaw
