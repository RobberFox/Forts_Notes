>Guys, what do you think of going eco combined with t1 tech? For example rockets at 4:00 with 6 upgraded mines (if possible), or going swarms + mortars with eco.
>Is it too late for t1? My idea is that eco rush t1 is still going to be faster than any t2 and I want to try capitalizing on that, what do you think - a good idea?
### Answers
**TareTar:** it's more beneficial to get your weapons out first, then upgrade the mines as you slowly expand. You can also go the surprise route and try to mimick a full eco build, then uncover a bunch of rockets inside your wood spam.
**EtaN:** probably viable but less useful that t2+eco or plain t1 rush. Upgraded mines+missiles is common *(due to sacrificed mines)*. Upgraded mines+rockets is ass[^1]

**Powfu:** I would go pinch rockets into upgraded eco, don't start with upgraded eco just wasting possible damage you could be dealing. Tho with pinch you don't even need upgraded eco. He has enough eco by himself.
**LuckIsSkill:** One issue with the strat is that while it may be faster than T2 weapons still, fast builds have weapons placed down by that time already. On top of that, you'll get beaten by other T1 rushes. Being able to stop the opponent from affording to place weapons is a lot better than hoping to kill/destroy weapons in the initial surprise *(if there is any)*. %% Maybe one use is avoiding charging architect %%

[^1]: Upgrading mines for rockets is questionable - when playing rockets there's always so much metal laying around and almost no energy all the time.
