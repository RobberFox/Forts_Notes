### Beginning: rush 0-3 min
>[!multi-column]
>>In parallel with eco I can utilize EMP's
>>>[!warning] My mistake
>>>I started placing doors before weapons. I could place 3 weapons beforehand *(untill buzzsaw comes)*
>>
>>Thus the weapons came very late *(4-5 minutes into the match)*

>>I needed doors for shotgun *(2 rocktes 2 shotguns)*.

### Early game offense: 3-6 min
>[!multi-column]
>>**With proper build order:** I could start rocket offence at 2:30 -> more energy -> mines -> Workshop *(at 5 minutes)*

>>**APM Issue:** I just didn't shoot from rockets despite using smokes.
>>Whole 6th minute was me not shooting.

### Mid game: 6-9 min 
1. The excess metal **had** to go towards front metal to defend from the cannon.
2. Once the first cannon shot dug through - I had annoying deformation. I was getting distracted by that instead of shooting.
### Late game: 9-12 minutes
##### The end
>[!multi-column]
>>I gave up on defending my base *(but I could push through the suck)* and got shot.

### Conclusion
>[!definition] Idea
>Typical 2 Rockets + 2 shotguns[^1] at *(3:00)* -> Turbines -> Mines -> Workshop

[^1]: Shotgun is a great map control weapon along with sniper.
