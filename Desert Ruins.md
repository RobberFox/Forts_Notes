### Designs
>[!multi-column]
>>Distance from core 30 wide.
>> 30 wide mortar foundation wood.
>>  go by 31 energy long planks.
>>**To shoot the mines:** portal-out should be parallel to the slanted front metal
>>**Precaution:** don't have max placement angle *(since fort wobbles)*, drag not $\perp$ but more to the side.
