### Setup
>[!multi-column]
>>
>>**Nameless king:** Firebird, Workshop, weird back turbines.
>>![[Pasted image 20240113220857.png]]
>>It's for mortars *(1:50 incendiary)*
>
>>**Dushnila:** Architect, High eco.
>>![[Pasted image 20240113220923.png]]

### Early game 2 - 6 min
1. No defense by Nameless king, Dushnila try to capitalize with emps.

2. Nameless king is inconsistent, mortar structure falls.

3. Very aggressive snipers

### Mid game 6-10 min
>[!multi-column]
>>**Nameless King:** mortar offence *(9 mortars)* at the expense of buzzsawability.
>>>[!gray] They could prolly upgrade mortars earlier
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240113221229.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>**Dushnila:** are overwhelmed, constantly burned down.
>>>[!definition] Upside for Dushnila
>>>They have eco to tank incendiary mortars ==for some time==
>

### Late game 10-15 min
>[!multi-column]
>>**Nameless King** don't have turbines defense.
>>They go into firebeams.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240113221439.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>As [[Forts-Asking-2|EtaN says:]]  you can go t2 asap to cripple the t1 mortars.
>>>[!warning] Dushnila don't do that
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240113221805.png]]

**Dushnila:** die from heavy mortars *(14-16 min)* and ==don't use their t2==

### Conclusion
1. If there is a weird turbine tower from Nameless king -> go buzzsaws to cut it.
