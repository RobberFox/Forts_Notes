>[!definition] Build order
Armoury -> 2 turbines -> Mine -> Upgrade center -> 4 Armoury weapons[^1]/coreswing -> Mine -> Upgrade -> turbine -> Doors

[^1]: Place 2 EMPs first for faster rockets *(since flaks upgrade faster)*
### Base design 
Use the [[Pillars-Coreswing|coreswing]]
Have turbine tower high to not be blocked by the front core defence.
##### First flow: sniper & flak
>[!multi-column]
>>[!blank-container]
>>Start off with a sniper.
>>>[!definition] Top Flak placement
>>>**1-3:** extend the [[Pillars#Coreswing|setup for tiny doors]]
>>>**4:** 61 energy long plank *(to have leeway during [[Box fitting]])*
>>>**5:** 50 energy long plank and drag down
>>>*- Place sandbag after 5: for a good measure*
>>
>>**Issues:** might by costly to have the **1-3** box.

##### Second flow: weapons beneath
>[!multi-column]
>>[!blank-container]
>>Have flak *(weak to explode weapon)* at front of the core and rockets *(severe to explode weapon)* below.
>>>[!definition] Weapons placement
>>>**1:** 20 energy long bisector. **2:** support plank **3:** max plank without ground node. **4:** drag sideways
>>>**5-8:** same as **1-4:** but mirrored
>>
>>Have weapons a bit behind to not obstruct the tiny doors setup $\downarrow$ [^1]

##### Third flow: tiny doors
[[Graveyard-Pillars-Rocket-Tiny doors]]
>[!multi-column]
>>Keep the bottom shotgun door since it provides stability.
>>**Everywhere else:** [[tiny doors]]
