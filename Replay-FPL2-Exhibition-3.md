>[!definition] ASAP Rocket rush master class on Up & Down 
### Setup %%Name: Commander, strategy%%
>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] Danke Merkel - Pinchfist no eco rockets
>>**Finn:** 3 rockets
>>**Amburullo:** 2 shotguns
>
>>[!definition] Green Leaf - Moonshine 20 mm
>>**Vykro:** 
>>**Dranistian:**
### Beginning: rush 0-3 min
**Danke Merkel:** Literally 2 mines, 3 turbines from both players. 2:15 rocket rush *(insanely fast)*
### Early game offense: 3-6 min
*- Vykro is completely crippled*
>[!multi-column]
>>**4:50** Finn transitions into buzzsaws[^1]
>>![[Pasted image 20240411134139.png]]
>
>>Dranistian has great trench gunners
>>![[Pasted image 20240411134217.png]]

[^1]: Though he doesn't door them since he only has 3 mines. One got sniped by Dranistian.

>[!multi-column]
>>[[Gunner-Minigun|Minigunner]] *(as I wanted)* from Vykro.

>>Finn's buzzsaw exposes the trenches.

### Mid game: 6-9 min 
>[!multi-column]
>>Vykro gets cut by Finn

>[!multi-column]
>>Finn has proper eco *(unlike Amburullo's 3 mines)*[^2]

[^2]: It's weird since Amburullo spent less on weaponry: he did double shotgun support. Probably due to the hanging base being cheaper to expand.
### Late game: 9+ min
*- Dranistian deploys 1 Moonshine 20 mil but it doesn't do much*
>[!multi-column]
>>Smokebomb -> Rocket -> Minigun -> Shotgun to cut the Dranistian's lower trenches.

##### The end
>[!multi-column]
>>Amburullo deploys a triple heavy mortar battery

>>![[Pasted image 20240411135612.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>Finn even builds an Amongi as a humiliation ritual.

### Conclusion
- Non-stop Schuka style barrage of fire like говном закидывать is insane.

Maybe balls to the walls no eco rushes *(like portalled mortars 2:20)* will help us with Pechivo win against MAF *(Monkey Air Force: EtaN, Matteo + Teutonic)*
