### Shooting cycle
Shoot the smokebomb and then group fire rockets **IMMEDIATELY**
### Nuke counter
It throws off the nuke guidance.
### Peculiarity
>[!example] Fire makes smoke go away
>Incendiary mortars, firebeams

>[!warning] This is why with [[Firebird]] shoot with the active and only then send the smoke
### Idea
Cannon + smokebomb to prevent Enemy's door repairing
