[[Rope]] 
### Notions
**Probably:** it has nothing to do with that. Because some swings work either way.
**Is there assymmetry?** Maybe forts prefers one side over the other *(I don't think so because coreswings are the same for both teams, right?)*
**One thing for sure:** high weight, high speed kills - thus try dampening with planks

>[!definition] Rope length
>The shorter the rope - the easier it is to compress above the [[Rope|threshold of 0.6]] and break.
>**But maybe this is wrong:** because [[Graveyard-Vanilla-Coreswing#Notion on MePre|some placements]] break the rope no matter the length.

>[!graveyard] 
>This might be because the core is on a single plank *(ropes attached to single planks are inconsistent)*
### Vanilla style
>[!tip] 
>During Pence swings, Minimal swing - the rope always bend in, towards the core then flicks to the other way - this might be the reason why it doesn't snap.

### Planks dampening
**IDK** if this truly works *(or if it's a placebo)*
>[!multi-column]
>>Make wooden contraptions that dampen the fall. Also on minimal swing it helps to orient the fort properly.
>>**Downside:** costly *(20-30 metal)*

### Ping issue
**Higher ping** - more change to die for me, maybe because:
1. Physics are more inconsistent

##### Swift swing (mine)

>>1. The rope has to be close to the minimal radius *(visual queue: node has to be on )*
>>2. Triple wood plank connection to the additional node.

##### MePre (Metal Preservation) swing
On this swing the core doesn't "cradle" onto the side. It violently falls with no support.
>[!multi-column]
>>**Like this is doesn't work:**
>>The rope snaps almost immediately. It bends out, away from the core *(might try to make it bend in, towards the core)*
>>>[!warning] 
>>>In this case the fort collapses on the rope like a Forts-swing-clamp shell. The rope is killed **prematurely**. This might has something to do with [[Rope]] 0.6 max compression.

If I increase the size of the rope the "clamp shell" action:
the relative compression decreases while the absolute "lacks behind" *(thus the rope doesn't break)*

##### Notion on MePre
>[!multi-column]
>>If I place a longer rope like this - it bends in 2 directions.
>>Rope of any length with this type of placement will snap.
