In general [[Mortar-Portal|I need to shoot with faster cadence]]
### Setup %%Name: Commander, strategy%%
>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] Spook
>>**Me:** fkin slow portalled mortars + late game armoury
>>**Pechivo:** Armoury support + mid game swarm -> nuke
>
>>[!definition] Overdrive
>>**PileRoullee:** Armoury turtle defence + late game laser tech
>>**Cypres:** Woodspam turtle + mid game firebeam/plasma combo
### Beginning: rush 0-3 min
No action, I need an agnostic portalled mortars setup.

### Early game offense: 3-6 min
>[!multi-column]
>>[!tip] Since I excess metal and don't have energy
>>Create a second portal for map control *(being able to punch both enemies)*
>>While switching portals - place more turbines.

>[!multi-column]
>>Pechivo didn't defend his mines from a shotgun

>[!multi-column]
>>After a strong punch I needed to control with sniper **but I messed up my sniper door and it was too low**

### Mid game: 6-9 min 

>[!multi-column]
>>Digging through the top base helps. The top eventually collapsed
>>But I could do better *(besides creating second portal faster)*:
>>- Add regular mortars to the portalled ones[^1]

[^1]: Don't forget stability and don't die like against team GYAT *(Gengar, Butterdog)*: [[FPL-Season-3#Tip]]
### Late game: 9+ min
>[!multi-column]
>>I could've changed targets right after crippling PileRouillee: those lasers are undefended *(and I had spook to see that)*
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407135540.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>[!example] Double buzzsaw cut by me
>>Pechivo should've shotgunned those immediately *(comms issue)*
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407135922.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] 10-th min: Sick sequence
>>1. That was the best part of the game.
>>2. Cypres dies quickly after that from nuke + mortars
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407140112.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>>[!warning] Too slow
>>That armoury was doing nothing most of the time since I didn't have enough turbines[^2]
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240407140246.png]]

[^2]: I at least could've upgraded my turbines
##### The end
PileRouillee dies from a shotgun: he didn't have enough energy *(turbines were constantly being shotgunned)*
### Additionally

### Conclusion
>[!multi-column]
>>[!warning] My base is too weak for 15 minute game
>>1. Portalled mortars of course carry me but I need rockets, nukes or t2
>

2. Change targets faster, the lower enemy is easier to hit.
