### Setup %%Name: Commander, strategy%%
**Me:** Spook Incendiary portalled mortars into heavy portalled mortars.
**Dranistian:** Pinchfist rocket rush
### Beginning: rush 0-3 min
>[!multi-column]
>>Should've gotten early 2 trench gunners *(1 above the sniper, 1 far below)*
>>![[Pasted image 20240530104154.png]]
>
>>Dranistian already sets up for gunner defence and has more energy
>>![[Pasted image 20240530104250.png]]

### Early game offense: 3-6 min
>[!multi-column]
>>[!definition] Me
>>My far down trenches were ass.
>
>>[!definition] Dranistian
>>1. Dranistian got a fast AP sniper.
>>2. Single rocket and single emp *(for better map control)*

>[!multi-column]
>>**4-th minute:** I took down a rocket and a shotgun with AP sniper at the expense of it
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240530104613.png]]

Should've upgraded my mortars faster
>[!warning] Huge problem
>My sniper got deformed and I didn't have angles to the enemy sniper: build outwards with 2 boxes *(to have proper exoskeleton)*
### Mid game: 6-9 min 
>[!multi-column]
>>**6-th minute:** Didn't have a sniper to shoot down the shotgun. Should've attempted a double sniper setup
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240530104804.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>**8-th minute:** 
>>1. Started building a minigunner too late.
>>2. Had no buzzsaw to cut off Dranistian's greedy expansions
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240530104932.png]]
### Late game: 9+ min
>[!multi-column]
>>**9-th minute, So bitter, almost turning point:** minigunner into mortars into sniper.
>>1. Didn't have a buzzsaw early enough to kill him
>>2. The sniper was too deformed *(again)*
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240530105047.png]]

>[!warning] I forgot about rebuilding gunners around 9-10th minute

>[!multi-column]
>>**12-th minute:** super greedy base by Dranistian. **Again** I needed buzzsaws, minigunners
>>

##### The end
### Conclusion
>[!definition] I need
>1. Better sniper, that doesn't deform.[^1]
>2. Better low trenches.
>3. Cleaner woodspam for easy weaponry placement in it.
>4. More offence with minigunners and buzzsaws.

[^1]: Either don't angle it much, or make exoskeleton.
