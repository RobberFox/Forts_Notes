### Setup %%Name: Commander, strategy%%
**ChinaGuy:** Immediate Firebird mortars
**EtaN:** Spook eco
### Beginning: rush 0-3 min
**2:00:** Etan protects the core with metal after the buzzsaw intel.
>[!multi-column]
>>>[!definition] **ChinaGuy:** triple mortars + buzzsaw by 1:35
>>>Then 2:40 triple low mortars *(6 in total)*
>>
>>![[Pasted image 20240723113331.png]]
>>Metal production is lacking: 3 mines total
>
>>>[!definition] **EtaN:** 2 gunners
>>>1. Steep shooting, protected by a sandbag from a ==shallow== trajectory
>>>2. Shallow shooting, protected from a ==steep== trajectory.
>>
>>![[Pasted image 20240723113735.png]]


>[!warning] Also EtaN forgot to get his 6th mine

### Early game offense: 3-6 min
>[!multi-column]
>>[!look]
>>EtaN continues the pattern of "shallow, protected from steep" and "steep, protected from shallow" gunners.
>>- Also exposed gunner  [[Forts-AA-Trench|for variety]]

>[!warning] Major mistake of ChinaGuy - doesn't know where to shoot :clueless:
>He wasn't shooting down the AA

### Mid game: 6-9 min 
ChinaGuy is still sitting on 3 mines and thus he expands to an Armoury too slowly

>[!multi-column]
>>EtaN bulds the sandbagged AA gunners
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240723114657.png]]

>[!tip] Also asap repair station after he notices the smokebomb

>[!multi-column]
>>##### Setup vulnerability
>>ChinaGuy should've build mortars at the core level.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240723114849.png]]

>[!multi-column]
>>##### Exoskeleton 
>>EtaN builds additional supporting braces after his turbine tower take a major hit *(some deformation)*
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240723114948.png]]

##### Counter offence

**8:00:** only now ChinaGuy expands his triple mines.

>[!multi-column]
>>EtaN is about to build mortars with a spot for AA gunner.
>>>[!warning] But he forgets to make the gunner and make it shallow
>>>The expansion collapses after fire+smoke.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240723115405.png]]
### Late game: 9+ min
EtaN is getting low 3 heavy mortars
##### The end
>[!multi-column]
>>EtaN's shots fly uncontested since ChinaGuy had no AA.
>>>[!warning] Fatal mistakes
>>>1. Missed the buzzsaw.
>>>2. Didn't target the mortars with his own.
>
>>![[Pasted image 20240723120035.png]]
### Conclusion
>[!multi-column]
>>##### ChinaGuy
>>1. $\times$ **Too little eco:** sitting on 3 mines deep into the midgame *(thus getting armoury late)*.
>>2. $\times$ **Not shooting down the AA/turbs:** just headbutting the sandbags for the first 4 minutes.
>>3. $\pm$ **Smokebomb + fire:** took down EtaN's low mortars[^1]
>>4. $\times$ **No flak:** => no proper AA counter.
>>5. $\times$ **No AA:** EtaN's first mortars were a red flag.
>
>>##### EtaN
>>1. $\checkmark$ Defends the core with metal *(after the buzzsaw intel)*
>>2. $\pm$ Almost full eco, just forgot the 6th mine.
>>3.  $\checkmark$ Variety of gunners *($\times$ only forgot gunners that defend his low mortars)*
>>4. $\checkmark$ **Buzz + sniper map control:** taking down the ChinaGuy's vulnerable top mortars.

Also ChinaGuy missed his last buzzsaw *(didn't take down the mortars)*

[^1]: ChinaGuy is sometimes throwing smokes that deplete due to his own mortars.
