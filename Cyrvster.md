>[!tip] 2-3 doored snipers are the best against sniper spam
### [[Eagle Eye]] sniper spam
Have hotkey'd 1-3 "main snipers" to win a sniper duel[^1]
8-9 EE snipers can destroy 4-5 [[tiny doors]][^2] *(great to do that in between cannon reload)*

[^1]: **If you have enough snipers:** camp the enemy's sniper door and just tab-e everytime you hear a door open.
[^2]: That depends on the door spacing and your aim.

>At most: I'll only door a single sniper, and only for the early game.
>The sniper duel-phase is really annoying/intense ==for both players==, though even pros might give up replacing snipers after a few minutes, not realizing how happy I am about that.
##### Rush of your own
No frontal gunners to free space for snipers. Go for Armory and use flaks if needed.
##### Not doored snipers but it's tough
>[!warning] The problem with doored snipers
>Costs a lot, too slow to open.

### Countering
##### Snipe the snipers + woodspam
>[!example] When the enemy is slowly winding up all of his snipers (chargin')
>Snipe 3-4 snipers, [[Eagle Eye#Knowledge|counter AoE with spaced woodspam, doors]]
##### [[Flak-Shotgun|Flak > Shotgun]]
- Flaks are better *([[Flak-Shotgun#Shotgun|shotgun deals 0.25 damage to snipers]])*
- Swarms are annoying *(but not a hard counter)*
